Attacker: Exploiting a vulnerability, the attacker aims to steal data from /etc/ssl/ but KubeArmor policy blocks access. They attempt privilege escalation but fail due to policy restrictions. 

Defender: The KubeArmor policy stops the attacker from stealing data and gaining higher access. The defender stays watchful because the attacker might try other ways. By using strict rules and keeping a close eye, defenders make it harder for the attacker to succeed.
