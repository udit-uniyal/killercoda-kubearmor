The Karmor CLI Utility is a tool that can be used to manage KubeArmor.

You can use karmor to view the logs for KubeArmor. To do this, open a new tab in KillerCoda and run the following command:

`karmor logs`{{exec}}

This command will display the logs for KubeArmor in the new tab.

If you attack your Kubernetes cluster after applying a policy using KubeArmor, you will see logs of the attack in the Karmor logs tab. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and investigating attacks.
