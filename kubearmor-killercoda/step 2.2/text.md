The Karmor CLI Utility is a tool that can be used to manage KubeArmor, a container-aware runtime security enforcement system. The installation command for the Karmor CLI Utility is:

`curl -sfL http://get.kubearmor.io/ | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin`{{exec}}

This command will download and install the Karmor CLI Utility to the /usr/local/bin directory.

Once the Karmor CLI Utility is installed, you can use it to view the logs for KubeArmor. To do this, open a new tab in KillerCoda and run the following command:

`karmor logs`{{exec}}

This command will display the logs for KubeArmor in the new tab.

If you attack your Kubernetes cluster after applying a policy using KubeArmor, you will see logs of the attack in the Karmor logs tab. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and investigating attacks.
