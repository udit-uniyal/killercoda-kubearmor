### Attacker's perspective:

Suppose no blocking policy is implemented in the /etc/nginx directory, and the attacker attempts to steal data. However, since the audit policy is implemented, we can access all the logs.

### Defender's perspective:

The defender is pleased to see that the KubeArmor policy audits access to the /etc/nginx/ directory. This means the defender can detect any unauthorized attempts to access the directory.

The defender can review the audit logs to identify any suspicious activity. For example, the defender may look for attempts to access the directory from unusual locations or at unusual times.

If the defender detects any suspicious activity, they can take steps to investigate the activity and mitigate the risk. For example, the defender may block access to the directory from certain locations or times.

Overall, the KubeArmor policy is a valuable tool for auditing access to sensitive folders and paths in Kubernetes. By auditing access to sensitive folders and paths, defenders can detect and mitigate unauthorized attempts to access those folders and paths.
