#### After Policy Enforcement:

**Policy Implementation:** The organization implements and enforces the 'Deny execution of package management tools (apt/apt-get)' KubeArmor policy to enhance security.

**Prevention of Unauthorized 'apt' Usage:** The policy now blocks the use of the 'apt' command as demonstrated in the following command:

```plain
kubectl exec -it $POD -- bash -c "apt update && apt install masscan"
```{{exec}}
```
**Mitigating the Attack:** With the policy in place, the attacker's attempts to install 'masscan' using 'apt' are thwarted. The policy denies the execution of package management tools, preventing unauthorized software installations
