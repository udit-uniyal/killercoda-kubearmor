If you run the command `kubectl exec -it $POD -- bash -c "chroot"`{{exec}} on a pod that is protected by the KubeArmor policy you provided, the KubeArmor policy will block the command and generate an audit log.

This is because the chroot command allows a process to change its root directory to a different location. This can be used to isolate a process from the rest of the system, but it can also be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the process.

The KubeArmor policy blocks the chroot command because it is considered to be a risky command. If the Nginx process were to use the chroot command to change its root directory to a different location, an attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the Nginx process to gain access to the rest of the system.

If you need to run the chroot command on a pod that is protected by KubeArmor, you can create a custom KubeArmor policy that allows the command. However, it is important to carefully consider the security implications of doing so.
