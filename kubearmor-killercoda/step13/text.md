Suppose an attacker tries to access the /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf file in a number of ways, depending on the vulnerabilities present in the server and the attacker's level of expertise. If the attacker gains access to the default.conf file, you can view the logs using:

`karmor logs -n default`{{exec}}
