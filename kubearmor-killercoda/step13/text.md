Suppose an attacker tries to access the /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf file in various ways, depending on the vulnerabilities present in the server and the attacker's level of expertise. If the attacker gains access to the default.conf file, they might use the following command:

```
kubectl exec -it -n default $POD -- cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```{{exec}}

To view the logs, you can use the following command:

karmor logs -n default
